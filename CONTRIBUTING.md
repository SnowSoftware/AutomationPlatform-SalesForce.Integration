## Contributing
First of all, we are genuinely greatful that you want to help us out.

There are many ways of helping us, even without writing code, so here are some ways you could contribute to make this a better product.

### Suggestions
##### No knowledge required

Is there some functionality missing?

Is the behaviour of our modules and functions wrong?

File a suggestion in the  GitHib Issue tracker and we will discuss the best way to solve your problems,

But always search to see if anyone already has reported the same suggestion before posting a new one.

### Issues
##### No knowledge required

If you find a problem with this module or code, please file an issue using the GitHib Issue tracker using the following guidelines:

  * File a single issue per problem and feature request.

  * The more information you can provide, the more likely someone will be successful reproducing the issue and finding a fix.

  * Please include steps to reproduce with each issue, including expected result and what you actually get.

  * If possible, simplify your code around the issue so we can better isolate the problem.

Please remember, before you report an Issue,
search the issue repository to see if a duplicate already exists.

If you find a problem with Snow Automation Platform, or any related Services, workflows, Activities, or other Automation Platform specific processes not related to this module or function,
please contact support@snowsoftware.com

### Development
##### Powershell knowledge required
If you would like to add or change something in this code, you are free to fork and do a pull request with your requested changes using the following guidelines:

  * Always follow powershell best practice guidelines found [on github.com/PoshCode](https://github.com/PoshCode/PowerShellPracticeAndStyle)

  * As far as possible, include Pester tests for your changes, or tell us why they are not needed.
  
  * Never use shorthand, Alias or other, non standard, terminology in your scripts.

  * If any external dependencies or specific powershell versions are required, these must be stated in #requires block.

  * Scripts should be well documented.

  * All scripts should support Powershell version 3.0 if nothing else is clearly stated inside the script.

  * If you change the behaviour of an already included module or function, this will be classified as a breaking change, and may be harder to implement.

When reporting an issue or doing a pull request, you must always follow our [Code of Conduct](code-of-conduct.md).


### Final checklist
  * [ ] Search to make sure the issue is new
  * [ ] Describe the issue clearly
  * [ ] Keep your code simple

And don't feel bad if developers can't reproduce right away. They will simply ask for more information.
